1. Lastly used css gets applied on top of all previously imported css in page.
e.g. 
<import a>
<import b>
'b' holds higher priority.

2. Style of first used class gets applied on content. 
e.g.
class= "a b"
'a' holds higher priority.

3. Even if u import contents from other page, style (css/js) of existing page gets applied.
